# obstacle-detection-car-pic16f877a

This is a project using assembly code to upload onto a pic16f877a attached to a motor driver and sensors.
The aim of this project is to have a car sense a obstacle, when it does the car is to turn 90 degrees to continue until finally it hits another obstacle and turn 90 degrees again.
This code was uploaded to the chip and tested by continuously integrating.
